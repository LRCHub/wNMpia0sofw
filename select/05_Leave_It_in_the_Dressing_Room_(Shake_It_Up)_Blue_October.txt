Time
What you gonna do
With your time
'Cause it's calling you
Abomination (so far)
You never have time for anyone
Are you living it up
Or packing it in
Hear everyone say
I think it's time we shake it up

We've been here for centuries
Now it's time we shake it up
What we came we came to do
Yeah we came to shake it up
When we came we came for real
Yeah we came to shake it up
I wanna shake it up

Down...
It's your thing
Get your face first falls
When I call you to the middle of the ring
Abomination (so far)
You never have time for anyone
Are you living it up
Or packing it in
Hear everyone say
I think it's time to shake it up

We've been here for centuries
Now it's time we shake it up
What we came we came to do
Yeah we came to shake it up
When we came we came for real
Yeah we came to shake it up
I wanna shake it up
